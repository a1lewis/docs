Do now: List the top 3 high school stressors.
 - Exams: There are a lot of tests that students need to study and prepare for. This can sometimes get people stressed out because they know that their entire future could depend on one test grade.
 - Homework: Sometimes, there is a lot of homework given, which could stress people out about getting it all done in time. It can be difficult to manage time between studying and homework.
 - Time management: Getting to school on time and making sure you get to all your classes on time is very important, as being absent can be both an embarrassment as well as a mark on your record for colleges to look at.
 - Safety: Getting around school is very stressful for some people. Especially because we are amidst a pandemic, going around school can be very worrisome for some students, as there's always a fear to catch SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19.
